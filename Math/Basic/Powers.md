Powers are when you multiply a number by itself the power's number of times, growing [exponentially](dictionary.com/browse/exponentially). Powers (A.K.A. Exponents, see [[PEMDAS]]) are written like so: $x^2$ With x being the value and 2 being the exponent. $x^2$ is called squared and $x^3$ is called cubed. Any number with an exponent of 1 will be 1.

### Example:

$2^3=2*2*2=8$
