P.E.M.D.A.S is an acronym for the correct way to solve a math equation / formula.
P.E.M.D.A.S stands for:

Parentheses
[[Powers|Exponents]]
[[Multiplication]] Division
[[Addition]] [[Subtraction]]

This is the order to solve an equation. For example, in this equation: $\frac{15+11}{2}-(1+3)^2\cdot2$ would be solved like this:

1. First you do the parentheses so $\frac{15+11}{2}-(1+3)^2*2$ would become $\frac{26}{2}-4^2\cdot2$
2. Then you do the exponents. Therefore $\frac{26}{2}-4^2\cdot2$ would become $\frac{26}{2}-8\cdot2$
3. Then you do the multiplication and division. Although the M is first in PEMDAS, it does not mean that you do it before division, rather you do these two on the same step, and work left to right. So, following this rule we would do **$\frac{26}{2}$** first, as it is the first multiplication/division problem from left to right, so that would be $13$ then we have $8\cdot2$ which would be $16$. Our new equation is: $13-16$ 
4. Finally we do the addition / subtraction. There is no longer any addition in this problem, so we solve for the subtraction, leaving us with a final answer of $-3$.
