The area of a triangle can be found with this equation: $\frac{1}{2}b\cdot h$ , with b being the base of the triangle, and h being the height of the triangle. So if a triangle had a height of 6 and a base of 4, then the equation would be $1/2(4)6$ which could be solved to $2\cdot6 = 12$. Thus the area of the triangle is 12.
