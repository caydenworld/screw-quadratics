The Angle Sum Theorem is a useful theorem to find the angles of a triangle. Take the following graph for example:
```
--------------^-------------
           a /c\ b
            /   \
           /     \
          /       \---
         /a       b\   \ d
         ------------------
```

Here, angles $a+b+c=180$ 
Similarly, $c+d=180$ which means that $d=a+b$
