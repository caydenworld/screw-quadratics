Slope Formulas are a collection of formulas to find the slope, slope intercept and angles or graph lines. The formulas are as follows:

Slope Intercept: $y=mx+b$ This is used to find the place on the y axis where the graph line intercepts.

Slope: $m=(y2-y1)/(x2-x1)$ This is used to find the slope of the graph line, which is rise (The y axis) over run (the x axis)

Point Slope: $y-y1(x-m)$ **EXPLINATION NEEDED**

Together, these formulas allow us to find the slope and intercepts of graph lines.
