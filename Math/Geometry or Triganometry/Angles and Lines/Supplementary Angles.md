Supplementary angles are angles that are the same or have a connection between their values. Take this for example:
```
                /a
---------------/----------
             c/
             /
           e/b
-----------/--------------
         d/f
         /
```
In this graph, there is a bisecting line going through 1 set of parallel lines. In this example the following angles are supplementary:

$a=d$
$b=c$
$c+e=180$
$a+f=180$
$e+b=180$
$d+f=180$
