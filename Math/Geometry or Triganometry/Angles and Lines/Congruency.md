Congruency means that two or more shapes are the same shape and size, or have the same ratio and same shape. For instance this triangle:

```
5/\5
 --
  5
```
 Is the same as this one:
```
10/\10
  --
  10
```

Even though they are different sizes, they are the same shape and have the same ratio between sides.
