## Description
This is a free github repository made for home/world schoolers trying to learn math. It is currently very limited however feel free to expand this database. This was originally made in [obsidian](obsidian.md) however can be viewed in any editor supporting markdown (.md) files. This includes github. And remember, screw quadratics!

## Contributing
To contribute, add a new folder, file or edit an existing file or folder and make a pull request. We have a couple of guidelines:
* No inappropriate posts or swear words
* All images must be ASCII art
* All posts must be obsidian compatible without external plugins
* Only add factual information
* Only add information that is relevant for highschoolers, middle schoolers or primary schoolers. No college level stuff.

## Using This Database
Feel free to fork this repository or download the files to use in ObsidianMD (or another markdown note editor) and use it as a collection of notes to help you with your work (that's why I made this in the first place ;)

## License
